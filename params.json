He succumbed to his injuries suffered in a road accident when Shilpi was only five. Since then her only support has been her mother who earns a living by making and seilling muri (puffed rice). Her teachers extended whatever help they could and even waived her school fees. Shilpi’s avid interest and indomitable will enabled her to score 87.3% in Madhyamik and 88% in the H.S Examinations. She came to Jadavpur University in 2011 to study Physics and it was then that she became acquainted with some members of Srijan Sujan who extended their helping hands. After completing her master’s with a first class she joined the B.Ed. course of the University of Burdwan in 2016. She is also preparing for competitive examinations. Srijan Sujan is committed to assisting her in her educational pursuits. </p>",
